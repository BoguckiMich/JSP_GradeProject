This project contains demo implementation of JSP. In this project we've used <code>Grade.class</code> as an example to test it's capabilities.

For now it is work in progress so this project only allows user to manage <code>Grade.class</code> in session using JSP as view. You can either add, delete, list.

Requirements of this project are:
- maven
- java (min version 8)
- tomcat server or any similar

You can build this project using command:
````
$ mvn package
````
Which will generate `*.war` file in the `target` folder.

You can run this Web Archive file (generated by the `mvn package` command) in the container such as:

## What can be improved
Adding JSQL and Hibernate as database.
